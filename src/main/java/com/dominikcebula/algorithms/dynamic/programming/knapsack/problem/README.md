# Knapsack Problem

## Description

The goal is to calculate the maximum profit of items that can be placed in a bag with a specified capacity. Each item
has an associated profit and weight.

Given `profits`, `weights`, `itemCount`, and `bagCapacity`, the task is to find the maximum profit achievable by
selecting all or a
subset of items that can fit into the bag without exceeding its capacity.

Items can either be fully included in the bag or not included at all.

## Input

* `profits[]` - an array of integers representing the profit of each item
* `weights[]` - an array of integers representing the weight of each item
* `itemCount` - an integer representing the number of items
* `bagCapacity` - an integer representing the maximum weight the bag can hold

## Output

* A single integer representing the maximum profit that can be obtained without exceeding the bag's capacity
