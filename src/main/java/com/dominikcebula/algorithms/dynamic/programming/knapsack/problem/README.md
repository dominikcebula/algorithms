## Description

Calculate maximum profit of items that can be put into the bag. Bag has a specified capacity. Each item that can be put
into the bag has profit and weight associated.

Given `profits`, `weights`, `itemCount` and `bagCapacity`, the task is to find maximum profit of items that will fit
into the bag.

Item can be put completely into the bag, or cannot be put at all.

## Input

* `profits[]` - array of integers - represents profit of each item
* `weights[]` - array of integers - represents weight of each item
* `itemCount` - integer - number of items
* `bagCapacity` - integer - maximum weight of items that can be put into the bag

## Output

* a single integer number representing maximum profit of items that can be put into the bag without exceeding it
